# HW_9
### Subsetting Data Frames

To complete this homework, you will need to clone and branch this repo. Then using RStudio, open the co2PerCap.Rmd file.  This file contains the questions and some example answers. You will also need the file: _data/co2_emissions_tonnes_per_person_gapminder.csv_.

You will collaborate with a partner to complete the homework. As with the previous assignment:

* Each student should complete the assignment on their own first.  
* Next, merge your answers on one student's cloned HW_9 repository.   
* Finally, the host student should make a pull request to hessllab/HW_9 to submit your joint answers. 

Please submit your answers in the form of a well-formatted and clearly documented _.Rmd_.
